Well, to be honest, I think he's not that attractive
It's getting boring, can we choose another topic?
That's not fun
It's a party just for us
We got lots in common, secrets we've been talkin'
You know what I'm thinkin', can you hear the ring ring?
Stay together, promise, I don't want us changing
Can't you see that it's our time?
No, B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
B-Y-O-B, without your boyfriend
Stop, you're not invited
Now, it's only for us
B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
He's on my SNS, keep liking all my photos
They say he's flirting, but how can you know it for sure?
That's not fun
Talkin' 'bout it all night long
And again we got stuck in a loop
That boy's too cool, too cute
I don't know, tell me what should I do?
I can't relate to you
Secret invitation, only rule in action
Can't you see that it's our time?
No, B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
B-Y-O-B, without your boyfriend
Stop, you're not invited
Now, it's only for us
B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
Da-da-da-da, ra-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, ra-da-da-da-da
Stop, you're not invited
Now, it's only for us
B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
Da-da-da-da, ra-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, ra-da-da-da-da
Stop, you're not invited
Now, it's only for us
B-Y-O-B, bring your own best friend
